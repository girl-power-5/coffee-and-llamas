        <h3>The IMOK Story</h3>
        <p>
          As the pandemic comes to an end, the world will once again become a
          place for all to explore. There will be a time where humans are no
          longer threatened by a deadly virus and we will all live in peace and
          harmony. Just kidding! Sure we may not have to worry about social
          distancing, but let's be honest, this world will always be a scary
          place for many.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group would occasionally discuss the fascination a lot of people
          have with serial-killer documentaries including ourselves. This of
          course led to the conversation about online dating and how safe it
          really is. As an all-female group, each of us has felt the fear of
          going out alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          When discussing the precautions we would usually take when going out
          or meeting a stranger, one woman said, "I never contact my friends
          when I get home...". We all paused and looked at each other. It's
          unfortunate, but we have been taught that going outside alone at night
          is not a safe thing to do and that you should always notify a friend
          when you're home safe.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This sparked an idea: what if there was an app for that? An app
          specifically made to be able to quickly and easily notify someone
          incase something were to happen when no one's around. With these
          thoughts in mind, IMOK was born.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>App Description</h3>
        <p>
          An application that gives the user the ability to let others know
          their current location when they go out so that if something were to
          happen, someone would be notified. A user will create a Safety Squad
          of up to 5 individuals who they are closest with, that they would call
          in case of an emergency, or say a really bad date. Each squad member
          will include a name and phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user would then be able to create the event which would include
          They would choose the day, time, and location of the meeting and most
          importantly who they are with and a link to that individual's social
          media. This information will display on the page and their squad would
          be notified of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day of the event, the user can check in when they arrive, and give
          their squad an update on how they're doing. The user has several
          options to choose from to provide status update.

          Keeping in touch with people is an important safety precaution. Being
          able to notify someone quickly can help avoid many scary situations.
          It's important to let people know that "IMOK!"
